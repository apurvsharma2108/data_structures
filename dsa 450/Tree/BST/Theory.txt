A Binary Search Tree is a Binary tree in which every right node is greater than the parent node 
and every left node is smaller than the parent node .True for every node
Why it is needed ?
The importance of BST is that search delete insert operations all are done in O(logn)
And if we want to reterive a range we can also  do that in O(logn)
